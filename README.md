### HTML/CSS/JavaScript Intro

These four components provide the underpinning of every web page.

| Technology     | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TEXT**       | The content/information the document wants to display.                                             |
| **HTML**       | **Hypertext Markup Language**. A _mark-up language_ to describe the content of web pages           |
| **CSS**        | **Cascading Style Sheet** - A _stylesheet language_ used to express the presentation of web pages. |
| **JavaScript** | A **programming language** used for both front-end and back-end development to add interactivity.  |

**TEXT:** a web page document starts out as just text content.

**HTML:** markup is used to give structure to the content. Markup elements are used to annotate the text to specify formatting such as headings, lists and hyper-links.

**CSS:** specifies rules to change style properties on selected HTML elements. CSS code is typically stored in a separate file and pulled into the HTML document. CSS is embedded in the HTML document here to make viewing it on one screen easier.

**JAVASCRIPT**: adds interactivity to the page. For example, you could bring up a video in a popup window when the user clicked on one of the jelly fish images (the code is a little too involved to display here, but you get the idea). JavaScript code, like CSS, is typically stored in an external document and pulled into the HTML document when it is being loaded.
